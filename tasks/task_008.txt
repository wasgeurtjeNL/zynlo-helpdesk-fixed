# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Real-time Collaboration Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build team collaboration capabilities including real-time presence indicators, internal comments, @mentions system, and collision detection for simultaneous editing.
# Details:
Implement presence system using Supabase Realtime with online/away/busy states. Create internal comments feature with visibility controls (hidden from customers). Build @mentions system with autocomplete and notification triggers. Implement collision detection using optimistic locking to prevent simultaneous responses. Add activity feed showing ticket history and agent actions in real-time. Create typing indicators for live collaboration awareness. Build notification system with in-app and email notifications.

**Collision Detection & Typing Indicators Implementation Completed** ✅

Implemented comprehensive collision detection and typing indicators for real-time collaboration:

## **Database Implementation**:
- ✅ **Version field**: Added `version` column to tickets table for optimistic locking
- ✅ **Typing indicators table**: Created `typing_indicators` table with proper indexes and RLS

<CollaborativeTicketForm 
  ticketId="ticket-id"
  initialData={{ subject: "...", description: "..." }}
  onSave={(data) => console.log('Saved:', data)}
/>
```

The system automatically handles:
- Version tracking and conflict detection
